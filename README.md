# FLGames

## What is it?
FLGames is a package of games I use in class to teach English

For the moment, 4 games are developed :
- Tictactoe
- Soccer
- Car race
- Grammar Gamble

I will append details on each game later since this repositery is also my discovery of Git and it takes me a lot of time trying to make things look nice :)

Note that data for games must be placed in data/ folder. You'll find name-of-the-game-data.txt files for each game. If you have images to use, put them in the data/img/ folder and link them [name-of-my-image.png] in the data files.

Please, note that development is not thoroughly tested since I'm more of an English teacher than a developper. Unit tests are still to be done because I don't know (yet) how to do them. My coding 'style' must be awkward, but I'm doing my best to learn the best approaches (if you have advice, I'm interested!).

I was curious on using AngularJS so that's what I'm doing in this FLGames package. Here again, a lot to learn and time flies by...

All my work is placed under the GNU GPL v3.0 license (found in LICENSE.txt).
All images come from the Open Source Clipart Library and icons from the Font Awesome Icons Library.

## What future for FLGames?

- Cleaner code
- Unit tests
- More games :)
- ...

## What else?
Hope someone will find this inspiring.
