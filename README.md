FLGames

Games I use in class to teach English

For the moment, 3 games are developed :
- Tictactoe
- Soccer
- Car race

I will append details on each game later since this repositery is also my discovery of Git and it takes me a lot of time trying to make things look nice :)

Please, note that development is not thoroughly tested since I'm more of an English teacher than a developper. Unit tests are still to be done because I don't know (yet) how to do them. My coding 'style' must be awkward, but I'm doing my best to learn the best approaches (if you have advice, I'm interested!).

I was curious on using AngularJS so that's what I'm doing in this FLGames package. Here again, a lot to learn and time flies by...

All my work is placed under the GNU GPL v3.0 license (found in LICENSE.txt).

= What future for FLGames?
- Cleaner code
- Unit tests
- More games
- More prctical game content interaction (for now, you have to manually modify myClasses.txt and myData.txt for games)
- ...

Hope someone will find this inspiring.
